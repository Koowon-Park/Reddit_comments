* Pictures you took during games go in the ""I Took a Picture"" thread.

If your image (or album) doesn't fit one of these categories (for example, interesting infographics, analysis, news, etc), you may post it in the description of a self-post. Please keep in mind that your image may be removed even in a selfpost, at the moderators' discretion, if it is does not promote discussion.

Thanks!

&gt; If an audio contains any value of non-consent or non-consent play, it must be tagged with the [rape] tag in the title. Similarly, bestiality must be tagged [beast], and **any character that is played to be under 18 must be tagged [age]**.

*Because there are people who filter search results to avoid certain content, mandatory tags must be used ~~a~~ as specified.  You are welcome to use both [age] and [ageplay], if you like.*

If you have questions regarding this rule, [you may submit a message to the Moderators]( http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgonewildaudio) for assistance."

It's active throughout the week and you will find plenty of people to help you there.
