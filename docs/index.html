<p>This project explores the intersection of knowledge graphs and generative AI using a Reddit comments dataset. Knowledge graphs, initially conceptualized by Rene Bakker in 1956 as a way to structure scientific knowledge, have evolved into versatile graph-based representations. Defined by McCusker et al.&nbsp;(2018) as sets of assertions (edges) between entities (vertices) that encode meaning, they incorporate provenance for justification and attribution. This project leverages knowledge graphs to model, visualize, and extract insights, demonstrating their potential when combined with generative AI for knowledge synthesis.</p>

<h3 data-number="1.1.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology"><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Methodology</h3>
<p>This project employed a variety of tools and technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> were used for data loading, cleaning, and processing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Neo4j</strong> and <strong>Gephi</strong> were utilized to construct and visualize the knowledge graphs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generative AI</strong> (via API integration) was implemented to interact with the knowledge graph and generate context-aware responses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The project workflow followed these key steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Data Preparation</strong>: The Reddit dataset was loaded, processed, and enriched with additional variables after an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge Graph Construction</strong>: Knowledge graphs were created using Neo4j, and further visualized and analyzed using Gephi.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration with LLMs</strong>: An API was used to enable seamless queries from Neo4j, demonstrating the ease and power of combining knowledge graphs with LLMs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This report is structured to provide a coherent narrative of our investigation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Introduction</strong>: Background, motivation, and objectives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data</strong>: Overview of the dataset and preprocessing steps.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</strong>: Key findings from data exploration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Knowledge Graphs and Generative AI</strong>: Construction, insights, and integration of knowledge graphs with LLMs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Reflections on the investigation and potential future directions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Through this structure, we aim to present a clear and compelling story of our exploration into knowledge graphs and generative AI using the Reddit dataset.</p>

<li><p>We also observe that the term ‘game’ is associated in term of frequency with sports subreddits like CFB (College Football) and Hockey.</p></li>

<p>The distinction between topics is clearer now.</p>
<p>We see that they reflect our subreddit which makes sense. It would be interesting to take more that 10 subreddit as we might uncover interesting grouping of subreddits but it is so computationally intensive that we refrain from doing that for now.</p>
<p>(You can a more detailled interpretation of the results in the Annex)</p>

<p>We also analyzed the distribution of topics across the documents (subreddits). This differs from the previous analysis, where we looked at the distribution of terms (words) across topics. Here, we look at the distribution of topics across documents (subreddits).</p>
<p>And it confirmed our previous analysis. We observe that topic 1 related to pc/games, topic 2 related to league of legends, etc. (see Annex for the plot and more details)</p>

<p>For our first analysis, we regrouped ALL comments per subreddit. From the results we obtained, we can argue that the LDA produced the best results:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was more efficient that the clustering and similarity analysis.</li>
<li>The subreddits are well regrouped, in a meaningful way.</li>
<li>The topics are well defined and they reflect our subreddits.</li>
<li>The topics are well dsitributed across the documents (subreddits), which is a good sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, regrouping ALL the comments per subreddits is not the best way to analyze the data. Indeed, we have a lot of specific words that are not taken into account by the stop words. Therefore, we will try to group in a more meaningful way, using the ‘description’ and ‘display name’ of each subreddit, obtained via web scraping.</p>

<p>We now test with 20 topics. We use this incremental method because of the heavy computational resources needed for this method.</p>

<p>Feel free to zoom on the graph to see which terms are most used for each topic. The LDA method has yielded the best results in our various tests. Based on the most commun words, we can infer that the topics are defined and that the subreddits are better regrouped. We therefore use it for our analysis.</p>

<p>The majority of the subreddits are not well associated with their dominant topic, Gamma can be seen as a probability (from 0 to 1) that a subreddit belongs to a topic. We can see that some with higher gamma (close to 1 ) are better classified than with lower gamma (close to 0) but there is still work to do.</p>

<p>Analyzing the top <em>30</em> subreddits (30 for vizualisation purposes) as a <em>whole</em>, focusing on average sentiment scores for each subreddit to get a general idea of the sentiment of the comments in each subreddit. We will use the AFINN, NRC, and BING lexicons to assign sentiment scores to words in the comments. We will then calculate the average sentiment score for each subreddit based on the sentiment scores of the words in the comments.</p>

<p>There seems to be more positive subreddits than negative ones.</p>
<p>We interestingly observe that based on the affin dictionnary the <code>news</code> and <code>politics</code> subreddit are the most negative, which could reflect a state of the world.</p>
<p>And <code>pc</code> Subreddits like <code>pcmasterrace</code> or <code>builapc</code> are the most positive.</p>

<p>The Bing sentiment lexicon categorizes words as either “positive” or “negative.”</p>

<li>Weaknesses: It lacks the granularity of numerical scores and may not capture the intensity of sentiment. It also does not account for neutral words.</li>
<li>Strengths: Easy to use and understand. It provides a straightforward classification of words.</li>

<p>BING seems to reflect the same proportion of positive and negative as the AFINN dictionary. Indeed, we observe the same pattern with <code>pcmasterrace</code> at the top and <code>news</code> at the bottom, but there is slight variation when compared to the AFINN dictionary.</p>

<p>The NRC Emotion Lexicon (EmoLex) associates words with eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (positive and negative).</p>

<p>Through the NRC dictionary we observe far more positive subreddits than negative ones. This imbalance could be explain by the fact that the NRC dictionnary is more biased towards positive words.</p>
<p>We still observe quite the same patterns though with <code>pcmasterrace</code> at the top and <code>news</code> near the bottom.</p>

<h4 data-number="3.4.1.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary"><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1.4</span> Summary</h4>
<p>To summarize it is interesting to observe that the NRC classification is totally different from the AFINN and BING classification. Indeed, the NRC classification seems to be more biased towards positive words but on the other hand it shall be more precise as it has more categories.</p>
<p>Which one to choose ? It depends on the goal of the analysis. If we want a simple and easy to use classification we can use AFINN or BING. If we want a more precise classification we can use NRC.</p>

<p>(see the Annex for interactive Tables where you can read the comments and the attributed sentiment based on each sentiment dictionary)</p>
<p>To have a more precise understanding of the sentiment of the comments, we will analyze the sentiment per comment for each dictionary (AFINN, BING, NRC). So that we can choose the best dictionary for our analysis.</p>
<p>We will analyze a sample of small comments to have a better understanding.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The AFINN method shows a relatively flat distribution with a slight peak around 0. This suggests that the sentiment scores are spread out, with a slight tendency towards neutrality.</p></li>
<li><p>The Bing method displays a bimodal distribution with two distinct peaks, one around -1 and another around 1. This indicates that the sentiment scores are polarized, with many comments being classified as either quite negative or quite positive. Which is logical based on the previous analysis</p></li>
<li><p>The NRC method has a sharp peak at 0, suggesting that most of the sentiment scores are neutral. This implies that the NRC method tends to classify a large number of comments as neutral, with fewer comments being classified as strongly positive or negative. But we note that the NRC is also quite condensed</p></li>

<p>We might choose one method over the others. For example, if we need a method that captures strong sentiments, Bing might be more suitable. For a more balanced view, AFINN could be the way to go. With more neutral comments, NRC might be the best choice.</p>
<p>We will go with the Bing method as it seems to capture the sentiment of the comments more accurately.</p>

<p>To complement our sentiment analysis, we perform a quick exploration of the score (Upvotes and Downvotes). First, we compute the total amount of comment with:</p>

<p>We see here that indeed, most comments in our dataset have a score of 1 or 2. Other exploratory graphs can be found in Annex, where the distribution of very popular (positively or negatively) comments are displayed. Overall, we find that most comments mostly follow a somewhat normal distribution, with most comments receiving little to no attention.</p>

<p>This graph allows us to identify the most interconnected subreddits in our dataset. Feel free to play with the interactive graph to see which subreddits are the most connected to each others. It’s important to note that this does not imply they are the most significant subreddits; rather, it indicates they are the most closely related to other subreddits based on the data we scraped from Reddit.</p>

1950s to the mid1970s descended from the modernist architectural movement of the early 20th century The term does not derive from the word brutal but originates from the French béton brut or raw concrete a term used by Le Corbusier to describe his choice of material British architectural critic Reyner Banham adapted the term into brutalism originally New Brutalism to identify the emerging style  gtBrutalism became popular with governmental and institutional clients with numerous examples in Britain France Germany Japan the United States Canada Brazil the Philippines and Australia Examples are typically massive in character even when not large fortresslike with a predominance of exposed concrete construction or in the case of the brick brutalists ruggedly detailed brickwork and concrete together There is often an emphasis on graphically expressing in the external elevations and in the wholesite plan the main functions and peopleflows of the buildings Brutalism became popular for educational buildings especially university buildings but was relatively rare for corporate projects Brutalism became favoured for many government projects highrise housing and shopping centres to create an architectural image that communicated strength functionality and frank expression of materiality  gtIn its ruggedness and lack of concern to look comfortable or easy Brutalism can be seen as a reaction by a younger generation to the lightness optimism and frivolity of some 1930s and 1940s architecture In one critical appraisal by Banham Brutalism was posited not as a style at all but as the expression of an atmosphere among architects of moral seriousness Brutalism as an architectural critical term was not always consistently used by critics architects themselves usually avoided using it altogether More recently brutalism has become used in popular discourse to refer to buildings of the late twentieth century that are large or unpopular  as a synonym for brutal  making its effective use in architectural historical discourse problematic  gt  gtImage i  Hubert H Humphrey Building headquarters of the US Department of Health and Human Services Washington D C    Interesting

Championship Leagues 1 and 2 and it runs from August to February The semi finals are held at the competing sides grounds and matches that end in a draw go into Extra time and penalties if required  The FA Cup is contested by every professional football club in both England and Wales and it runs from August to May However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round which is called the First round proper which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter   Eventually they hit the 3rd round and thats where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper   Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground example United vs Arsenal ends 11 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties   Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final The semi final is played at Wembley with the final also played at Wembley   Long post but there you go The League Cup isnt taken as seriously by bigger teams hence why Sunderland Swansea Bradford Cardiff and Birmingham have been finalists in the last 4 years but the FA Cup is always regarded as the best cup competition in the world due to its rich history","rspace would love this","Steam support doesnt even ban the guy who

hotend but a fan duct printed and installed that put airflow across the heat sink on the head fixed the issue  You can see from most of the comments already that the theme with the TAZ is frustration yet in the end theyre glad they went with it  Once you do find the sweet spot though its a beast of a printer that has no problems printing 247  In fact Lulzbot prints 245 with over a hundred of them  As ujebba said in another thread theres a new all metal hotend very close to production likely about the same time as their new mini printer  Im sure the TAZ 5 will have the improvements such as the self leveling system and new hotend  I cant say anything really bad about Makerbots 22x  They have their own issues but once you work on them a bit theyre solid workhorses  The 5th gens stay away for now  MakerGear M2 is a really solid printer  I know a few people who own them and if you look at 3dhubs guide the printer is very well liked  A printer I would highly suggest is an Ultimaker 2  It has a smaller build volume than the TAZ but its far less picky with settings  Its my first choice when printing most of the time just because it works with minimal fuss and can print faster at the same quality levels  With ninjaflex and composite ninjaflexABS parts the TAZ wins hands down though  If you can accept the build volume the Flashforge Creator Pro is a nice choice and very well built  Any part that has a higher potential failure rate is easy to replace and spares are on their site  It doesnt hold your hand when it comes to documentation though","Great Article Thanks for sharing If we

highend overclockable CPU which youre spending extra for by the way without buying a cooler and to go along with that youre buying a shit lowend video card So the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste while the video card will be huffing and puffing straining at the seams  Drop the CPU down to a nonoverclock i54460 or 4590 and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X and youll be playing every modernday game at a smooth 60 FPS on HighUltra settings  for nearly the same price If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself youd be lucky if you got 3040 FPS on High and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 3040 which is a minimum by any PC gaming standard Of course the fact that you dont have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates but do you really want to limit yourself like that Surely at some point youll want a better monitor theyre only about 120130 for a highquality IPS LED and your hardware wont be able to keep up with it  If your intention is to play video games on this PC youre making a big mistake I urge you to heed my

opinion a great addition to the game Ive been running massive amounts of T4 missions recently because of how insanely fun it has become However this is also because I have high RoF weapons in my T4 load out The nullifiers and eximi shields need to follow the rules placed onto player controlled Globes This means explosive munitions Ie Penta nades Ogris rockets or blast procs need to affect the enemies within the shield as they do on players Or conversely players should finally be immune to procs coming from outside the globe and into it \r\n\r\nAnother thing DE should consider is removing the damage limit on shields Its pretty ridiculous how high RoF weapons are better against Nullifier shields Ive noticed this is only on Nullifiers that slow high damage weapons To put this into perspective my Boltor Prime shoots spikes that deal 800 damage to the nullifier shields My opticor deals 8640 damage to the shields yet it always takes around a full opticor mag 5 shots 9 shots with multishot to take the shield down DE needs to remove the damage limit the shields can take from one damage source allowing the viability of both high RoF and slow RoF weapons to be viable\r\n\r\nAn idea Ive been tinkering with is to make the shields susceptible to weapon procs Blast procs can CC enemies inside the shield while Magnetic procs can deal more damage to the shield itself By introducing this mechanic Void missions become more dynamic as players have to choose when and where to switch weapons\r\n\r\n\r\nTLDR 1 unify rules with regard to out of body shields Players should be able to affect enemies in shield or be immune to them inside their own\r\n\r\n2 Remove damage limit on shields to make slow RoF weapons viable against nullifiers\r\n\r\n3 Add elemental weaknesses to the shields bringing more variety to weapon elemental choices in the void","Losing weight is not the most important thing  Fuck  You make mcds a staple and youre going up have cancer cardiovascular

although technically it could net value with Mad Scientist because I think it is just insane in games that go to fatigue All the cards you mentioned are no doubt key in control but 5 additional cards 5 turns when youre not taking fatigue seems absolutely insane to me Also this card only get better in time as more cards that interact with Secrets and have Mad Scientistesque effects into the game Id gladly agree that no one would ladder with this card but I think against control it could be insanely useful  I think Shadow Summoner doesnt produce an insane amount of burn at all you pay 9 mana just to get the first Shadow Bomber on board 6 for the card 2 for hero power 1 for the Bomber and you can only Hero Power once per turn If you have pressure to go along with it then yes it will do work but on its own I dont think its that strong at all  For Tinkerer I imagined this card less as a Jeeves who simply allows any class to be zoo and more like a miniGazlowe I think if you even have two cards on board that generate Spare Parts like a Gnome and Yeti and you trade them in this card gives you value Two extra Spare Parts with Gazlowe or Antonidas or even Auctioneer is really good and youre not paying too much to get them   Beastmaster can have synergy with Hunter cards obviously allowing you to Houndmaster anything enable Kill Command etc etc This can let you do stuff like turn 4 Yeti turn 5 Beastmaster  Houndmaster or turn 3 Harvest Golem turn 4 coin Beastmaster Houndmaster basically it allows a workaround for there being a low number of good beasts in the game It also synergizes with Druid of the Fang I dont know if thats enough to make Beast Druid viable but I think its worth considering And the most important part for me it is a vastly superior Black Knight  Mark of the Wild with Hemet Nesingwary a 6 mana Assassinate that also summons a 63 and a 21   Generator is insane if you can get value from it but you have to run the Paladin secrets in exchange which are pretty mediocre And they wont get amazing value with the board state except for Avenge Redemption will be bad if they kill the Generator Noble Sacrifice wont be spectacular and the other ones will be garbage as usual  Ill agree that Shadowy Archer is too strong do you think making it a 12 would be fine still better than Creeper but it is a class card  For the Tortoise it does seem limited but I think in a deck with a lot of card draw or a deck that can afford to blank on several draws playing 22s over and over and over again will eventually just win you the game A comparison could be made with Hogger in terms of how 22 Taunts can snowball out of control Also its a Beast though I dont know how useful that is  I didnt consider the Shade comparison with Fel Imp at all I think its advantage is that it can grow much quicker when making it I was thinking of the synergy with Floating Watcher you tap and simultaneously grow both of them at once Also with Blood Imp on board he grows faster than Shade as well although not by much Hes probably a much worse play in the early game but I think when you can play him and a few healthbuffing effects immediately he shines  For Neighborhood Blacksmith I think the problem with him is that in order for him to be good you have to have a lot of weapons but then you cant use them all because you have a ton of durability on the one you have And if you only get a few more charges then hes pretty comparable to Greenskin  with 1 minion hes just worse with 2 its arguable 11 on the weapon but 2 Attack so it takes 3 minions on board for him to be a better Greenskin Which for current Warrior decks isnt that easy to achieve  Thanks again for the response","I do what every other lazy employee at this store cant be arsed to do

it hard to really register others feelings when theyre trying to motivate me so I made a video where I convince myself in a time of need to move on   This is both to prevent procrastination and

Marrone","Hey  I get your point  unfortunately i think you either responded to the wrong topic or got confused  this post was about tight rulesets not about balance but you seem to use those interchangably  You can make tight rules with an unbalanced system or a balanced system with not tight rules  If it was about balance well warmachinehordes is one system that supports 14 full factions and warhammer 40k has 18 really about 16 if you dont include some armies that are meant to be allies and not full factions  fantasy doesnt have to be balanced against 40k so its not included  So the difference isnt so great  unless you think the jump from 14 to 1618 factions really breaks the camels back there but i cant see it     But back to the tight ruleset   warhammer 40ks main rules problem isnt the vast number of rules  Its not the minute rules interactions  Really the core problem is the rules arent written in a systematic fashion  A systematic rule set lays down terms and uses them to create a complete and bounded system  40k has decided not to go this route and elects not to fully define terms most of the time and often uses many similar terms with slight differences to mean the same thing leading to confusion  40k rules are written when the rules writer has an idea in mind and jots down what he thought in plain english  Most games with tight rulesets has the creator think of a rule then they write it down in the confines of the rules set  To use an example earlier today  a single passenger can fire out of each Fire Point  This is a poor rule as it stands because the timing is not defined and 40k doesnt even have a definition for what firing means  do you Fire psychic shooting attacks  Are you firing once or twice if you shoot two shots from the same weapon  are you firing twice if you shoot two different weapons  A tighter defined rules set would have defined fire as making a ranged attack and ranged attacks as psychic shooting etc  It would let you know if that is per phase or per turn or per firing step or what the timing is  To use an example from a comprehensive ruleset in magic theres a card that makes all blue lands produce an extra mana  In 40k it might very well be a psychic power that reads All blue lands produce an extra mana    That would be a terrible rule  produce is not defined it doesnt say when they make the extra mana when they produce do they produce two  do they produce one now and one at the normal time  Theres just a lot of problems with that wording you know this without even playtesting it  Thats why magic words it Until end of turn whenever a player taps an Island for mana that player adds Blue to his or her mana pool   The timing is defined tap is a defined term in the rules everything about the rule uses defined terms and fits perfectly into the ruleset  Just reading through different games rulesets you can instantly tell by their format and terminology if they were designed to be a comprehensive system or a just descriptions of different things the author envisioned 40k reads like someone explaining the game to a friend not a set of comprehensive rules you can make a complete system from  Its not the minor interactions that come from having so many rules its the way they are written","Thank you  I know what you mean about it being exhausting Im glad for you as well its amazing how much

people oppose abortion is because they believe the organism being aborted is a homo sapien and if it is a homo sapien then abortion is murder which is something libertarians oppose  The reason people oppose abortion is not because God said it is bad  Therefore the criticism against the opposition to abortion is itself based on something imaginary  a belief either no one or practically no one has  Even if people believed that abortion was wrong simply because God said it was wrong then that still would not justify opposing laws against abortion because otherwise we would have to oppose laws against murder given there are people who support laws against murder due to God saying it is wrong","Photoshop so large file size sounds about right","Dude thank you so much sorry for all the hassle

later but when attempted it was in backwards feudal countries The attempts resulted in class based authoritarian command economies that failed The Manifesto summarised their analysis the big battles between the feudal order and the bourgeoisie were imminent  1848 was a year of revolutions in Europe In 1871 the Paris commune was founded The russian revolution started in Russias industrial centers Moscow and St Petersburg and this is where Bolshevicks had support In the country side other socialists were far more popular At the same time there is an uprising or riots or whatever in Germany that is put down by SPD at the time an officialy marxist party  Marxism never really caught on in the anglosaxon world there were cases when socialists would get up to 5 or 6 of the vote followed by Red Scares see Eugene Debbs or read the Grapes of Wrath for a closer look at that era and it then got mixed with the anticolonial movement that flourished in many less developed countries with economies

fuel Its to get ahead of the driver plain and simple  The typical argument I hear on Reddit is how we should just stay in the lane so people in cars dont get held up from us passing  First off fuck anyone who says that Its fucking selfish  If Im going 65mph on flat ground and another driver is going 64mph Im going to go around him because I want to keep going 65 and not 64 just because people driving a car cant wait a minute while I pass someone  If the guy Im passing does 64mph 11 hours a day he will do 704 miles If he does that 5 days a week for a whole year thats 183000 miles per year that hes doing  Now I come along doing 65mph Which using the same math I cover 2000 more miles a year than him   On a typical day with my current outfit I make about 250 per day doing about 350 miles So since Im covering 11 more miles than him a day but I get stuck behind him doing 64 that means Im losing 250 per month  Now he doesnt directly cause this loss of income because hes just trucking along minding his own business But Im losing money by going slower because I get less loads done per year going slower than I usually go  So regardless if someone is approaching Ill swing around him get back up to speed pass him and then move back over And then you can go by no problem  Additionally I dont want to stare at the back of a trailer I know I can pass Anyone can agree with that   If

analysis of beerswines you have previously rated   So for example if you are at the grocery store and you are not sure about a beer you can scan the label and it will give you a score like 878 or 376 which is just their guess at whether or not you will like it Ive played with it a little by scanning beers I know that I already know I like or dislike and and I think it does give make pretty damn good predictions once youve added enough reviews to your profile  If you rate a beerwine in their app it wont tell you If you liked this then you might like Beer X the way untappd does It just stores that score data and uses it develop a profile for your likes and dislikes     Their biggest shortcoming is that they actually have to have a sample of the beerwine sent in for analysis to be able to rate it so their database is lacking all but the more widely available and mainstream beers for the most part Its still pretty new and growing though and they claim to be constantly adding more and

response in order to test the person is a bad idea in general and I think its especially bad if theyre INTJ Were good at picking up on that sort of thing and we dont like it If we feel like someones

feelings  The Im busy responses sound to me like an indication that he doesnt care much about you Youre just online friends youve never met or spoken to each other It sounds like he doesnt think its a very close relationship I dont know if this is common with INTJs but I dont feel very close with people I only know online If someone online tells a sob story Ill probably say something sympathetic just to be polite and I feel sorry for them just like I feel sorry for someone I read about in the news whos suffering but I dont actually care like I would about someone Im close with INTJs take a while to warm up to someone we tend not to have a lot of close friends It sounds like youre expecting a high degree of emotional connection from someone who might just see you as an acquaintance or casual friend because he doesnt know you well enough yet Its not a matter of you telling him more about your life theres no way to force it If you want to get closer with him then try to have more

is working out do I go back to my old characters or do I start over and the biggest and toughest question with that is where to go and what to do to find other players and what to do to make friends

on and i assume would during the psychosis scene later was the relationship between Olive and Caden and Olive and Adele You showed eaches reaction to her becoming upset at the idea of having blood but their relationship itself wasnt talked about if Im remembering correctly It always seemed to me that Adele wanted to push the responsibility of Olive onto Caden yet when she leaves she takes Olive with her Almost as if shes enjoying the fruits of Olives childhood but leaving Caden to eat the rest Further is the idea that Olive is in fact an extension of Caden Adele can never escape Caden as long as Olive is with her which to me comes back to the scene where Olive is afraid of the blood inside her Caden tries to tell her that yes she has blood he wants to feel a bit of himself is in Olive but Adele tells Olive that she doesnt have blood saying Caden is not in Olive which allows her to escape from Caden with Olive and not feel like or able to deny that Cadens work still lingers in the

but not the rest of the WP Please forgive me I made up my own warning message   Jake awoke to the rumbling sound of helicopters flying low over his house Sitting up slightly and squinting through the haze of sleep he looked at the clock on his nightstand Instead of the glowing red numbers there was only darkness Then he checked his watch  354 AM   With a sigh he dropped back onto his pillow causing his wife to stir and mutter something unintelligible Just then a searchlight swept across his yard illuminating his bedroom windows before moving on  Fucking Mondays He said aloud Beside him his wife continued to sleep soundly despite the continuing noise He rolled over and put an arm around her smiling as he snuggled close to her warmth envying her ability to sleep through anything   Then over the drone of rotor blades an announcement sounded in an amplified voice A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government Power and electronic communications networks are down For your safety everyone is ordered to exit your homes remain on your front lawn and await further orders The message began to repeat What He thought utterly confused Everyone has to go outside Whats going on Begrudgingly he arose and walked to the window as a spotlight swept his house again Down the street he could see several military vehicles as well as a few patrol cars with red and blue lights flashing Several of his neighbors were already on their lawns looking sleepy and bewildered in their nightclothes Then he noticed what looked like a greyhound bus being loaded What the  What is it honey Sue asked having finally awoken and sat up  I dont know The police and the military are down the street and they are ordering everyone outside It looks like they are loading people onto a bus  The military A bus She sounded incredulous Then she heard the announcement amidst the cacophony   A state of emergency has been declared by the United States government Power and electronic communications networks are down For your safety everyone is ordered it continued   Theyre coming up the street Jake said They just kicked in Rob Merkeles door His pulse quickened  Theyre doing what Sue asked still not fully awake  Theyre dragging his family outside   Who The police  The military He turned from the window to face Sue Fuck this I dont know whats going on but I dont like it  What are we going to do She asked  He pulled the blinds back again but didnt answer The windows were shaking from the helicopters They just kicked the Hamptons door in  By now Sue had gotten out of bed and was standing beside Jake looking out of the window  Get the kids up and get them in here He said  Right Said Sue and ran from the room and down the hall turning lights on as she went  Two more houses and they would be here What to do What to do He thought about hiding places within the house The attic The back of a closet The trunk of their car Nothing was right Should he just go along with this  Sue came back with their two children Tom 5 and Emily who was 7 They were on their feet but still mostly asleep   Go grab a bunch of their clothes and any medicines they may need Weve only got a few minutes They are almost here   What to do What to do He kept asking himself aloud Must he go along with whatever this was How could they get away Scanning his memory of the area he remembered a drainage ditch beyond his property in the back yard that ran into a large tunnel It was a chance  Jake ran out of the room to find his wife Sue Sue  Yes The sound came from Emilys room   Sue Quick get them dressed as best you can and shoes on their feet we are going to try to get out by the drainage tunnel behind the house  The drainage tunnel Is that safe She asked  Its our only chance  She was still doubtful We dont even know whats going on They may shoot us if we run And if we do get away what then  It was obvious how scared she was as she was standing there in her nightgown bundles of clothes in her arms  There was a hard knocking at the front door They both jumped at the sound Open up Open the door Pound Pound Pound There were several voices Everybody on the street now Open up Open the door or we will break it down Pound Pound Pound  The look in her eyes as she shook her head no told him all he needed to know She wouldnt be running anywhere with the kids For a moment they just stood there looking at each other in the midst of the chaos Pound Pound Pound  Ok He said and walked to open the front door  There was a large crash as the door busted open The cops or military men he couldnt tell streamed inside They were dressed in all black and their weapons were at the ready   Police Police they yelled as they progressed through the house They came upon his family huddled on the bed in Jake and Sues bedroom  Everybody on the floor Everybody down Get on the floor  Jake was in front of his family his arms spread wide covering as much of them as he could  On the fucking ground now The point man yelled His weapon was pointed at Jakes head where a red dot now bounced and jiggled Do it now Do it now  Jakes heart sank He was powerless Here were a bunch of armed men threatening his family and all he could do was shield them with his body Both of their children were sobbing as his wife held them  On The Fucking Ground Now The point man shouted The other men behind him were now coming in and shouting orders and pointing their weapons The point man grabbed Jakes wrist and yanked him off of the bed throwing him to the ground and putting a knee in his back The second man in grabbed his wifes wrist pulling her to the ground causing her to scream  Hey Jake shouted pulling his head as far off of the ground as he could trying to see Stop hurting my wife His arm was grabbed twisted behind his back and a handcuff was snapped around his wrist  Stop resisting the man on top of Jake yelled  A third man came into the room grabbed his daughter and threw her to the floor She yelled as he did so and began crying loudly  Stop you motherfuckers Jake yelled   The person on top of him put an elbow into his face Shut up and stop resisting He twisted the other hand around his back preparing to cuff him Spurred on by the cries of his family and without thinking he tried to roll over but had no leverage This prompted another elbow to the face He tried throw the guy again This time his left leg found purchase against the nightstand and he pushed   Under normal circumstances there would be little chance of anyone bucking a trained fully grown man off of their back but this was a father protecting his family A split second of superhuman strength was all that was needed to send him flying against the dresser Flailing the cop or whoever grabbed at a partially open drawer as he fell and brought the dresser down on top of himself Jake now on his feet barely avoided the falling dresser as he lunged for the person on top of his wife at the foot of the bed  He had his knee in the back of her neck and was preparing to cuff her when they made contact Both went rolling Jake ended up on the bottom The man threw several punches and landed a few on Jakes face then paused and reached behind himself Jake took a swing at the mans face but his fist missed The free end of the half fastened handcuff did not It struck the man squarely in the cheekbone making solid contact enough to break the bone and send blood pouring from his nose and cut onto Jake That sent the mans hands to his face as he let out what would have been if not for the circumstances a comically effeminate scream Jake did not notice All he knew was that the man was no longer trying to fight Another swing and the handcuffs connected with his temple silencing him  Jake struggled to his knees pushing the man off of him and got to his feet The other person clearing the house hearing the struggle now made his way down the hall and into the room Seeing his one comrade holding his blood covered face and the other struggling to get a dresser off of him he went into kill mode He raised his weapon and pulled the trigger as Jake came at him The sound was instant and sharp quickly reducing the noise of his kids crying the helicopters outside everything to a high pitched ring  Jake did not feel the bullet pierce his midsection right below the sternum was not aware of the 223 rounds tumble as it ripped through flesh and guts spilling bile and blood where it should not go Jake was only aware of the man in front of him at as his momentum carried them both to the floor This time Jake was on top Rage consumed him Viciously he punched the man trying to destroy him his very existence Over and over his fist made contact with the mans face nose mouth Teeth cut his knuckles which began to bleed Blood splattered everywhere","I dont mind doing the beginning area again if you are capable of passing the bridge","Congratulations that was the correct answer Please

Russian maps the Crimean peninsula is already included as part of Russia while much of the rest of the world portrays it as still belonging to the Ukraine Whether or not a map includes Western Sahara probably depends a lot on who draws the borders on it  Countries dont exist the same way mountains and lakes do They are not indisputable features of geography they are social constructs If you are going to sell your maps in areas where certain countries or borders are not officially recognized it would be a good business decision to conform to the local official definitions rather those

Atlantic Financial bought the company Fleetwood Video some years back and changed the name to FDVT or Fleetwood Digital Technology Corp I believe 2004 or so but I am not positive  certainly quite a while back  A family of a deceased business owner approached me and asked me to buy the business for what seemed to be a cheap rate  I figured it had enough revenue to cover the purchase cost and some goodwill from being so old founded in 1985 and the customer list and registration to do business with the government  The company served the clients mentioned  mainly selling blank video tapes for security cameras  Thats pretty much what the business did  One of the Atlantic Financial employees had plans to make it into more of a broad consulting company but we didnt     The company continued those services for a couple years as the contracts wound down and never worked in those areas again  We considered pursuing some government business but didnt  The company never asked for or got any new government contracts and the one part time employee who was on board with the aquisition moved on  the internal employee working on it moved on   The small amount of revenue that came in covered most of the costs of the purchase    I had thought that the business might have had value since it is a service disabled veteran business and Im a disabled vet  but I never used that certification or pursued those lines of business  Its really not my cup of tea  I had also considered using the business as a vehicle to help out a freind who is a martial arts trainer who had trained military and police  so he could run contracts through the business since it was registered in all the databases needed to do business with the government but it was too much effort relative to the reward  We scrapped all the inventory delisted all contracts with all government agencies and turned the shell of what was left into basically a catch all for web development and domain names we are afflicted with   The company took on a couple small web consulting clients in later years  At the time  2004 or so I was not as adamantly against the government as I am now  I had some interest in some types of government contracts  I didnt pursue them but some of the work such as USAID efforts in Pakistan and security work interested me  I didnt pursue it it doesnt interest me now and I dont do any government work now   Even the tiny bit of work that this company which was owned by my company did was not something I was personally active in or profited from  I am only giving so much information

<h1 data-number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Knowledge Graphs</h1>
<p>Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide a robust framework for representing, managing, and analyzing complex relationships between entities. They serve as valuable tools for uncovering patterns and gaining insights from interconnected datasets, such as Reddit discussions.</p>
<section id="neo4j" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="neo4j"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Neo4j</h2>
<p>The initial construction of our Knowledge Graph was implemented in Neo4j. In this representation, we categorized the nodes as follows: authors in <code>blue</code>, comments in <code>pink</code>, themes in <code>green</code>, scores in <code>orange</code>, and sentiment in <code>red</code>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>First Graph - Neo4J</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As we increase the complexity of the graph by incorporating additional nodes and relationships, the relationships between different entities become more evident.</p>

<p>Further complexity reveals richer insights but also introduces challenges in interpreting the data visually.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gephi"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Gephi</h2>
<p>As the complexity increase neo4j becomes really non efficient so we can use Gephi to visualize the graph.</p>
<section id="openord" class="level3" data-number="4.2.1">
<h3 data-number="4.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="openord"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> OpenOrd</h3>
<p>Openord is a force-directed layout algorithm that is based on stress minimization. It is a good choice for large graphs.</p>

</div>
<p>Adding the scores nodes in blue did not help to understand the graph. So we’ll try another layout.</p>

<h3 data-number="4.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="yifanhu---i"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> YifanHu - I</h3>
<p>YifanHu is a force-directed layout algorithm that is based on the physical model of the system. It is a good choice for large graphs as well</p>
<section id="themes" class="level4" data-number="4.2.2.1">
<h4 data-number="4.2.2.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="themes"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.1</span> Themes</h4>
<p>Using YifanHu on gephi we can observe here an interesting representation of the prevalance of different theme in our dataset.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>YifanHu I - Color Labels</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We observe here that theme 9 which is about ‘Sports, Teams, and Player Discussions’ is the most prevalent for example.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<h4 data-number="4.2.2.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sentiment"><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2.2</span> Sentiment</h4>
<p>adding sentiment in green (positive) and red (negative) complexifies the graph but can be useful to understand the sentiment of the different themes. We observe for example that theme 9 as a lot of ‘red’ which means that it is mostly negative compares to other themes.</p>

<p>Theme 9 that we previously identified has interestingly a lot of high scores (lots of green) even if the overall sentiment is negative. This can be due to the fact that people are passionate about sports and can have strong opinions about it.</p>
<p>On the other hand theme 2 which is about ‘Politics, Science, and Star Wars’ has a lot of neutral scores.</p>

<p>It was tried here to identifies connection through theme between authors with a similarities score found through an THEME_AUTHORS relationship on NEO4J.</p>

<figcaption>Similarities Overview</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We observe that the small dots (authors) on the <code>left</code> side have a lots of connection through different theme nodes. Whereas the more right you go the less connection you have. With a minimum of connection on the far right with 2 connection per author.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/images/clipboard-2533163853.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<p>For example here we observe the relationship of authors based on theme 1, which correspond to ‘Rules, Information, and Wiki Communitie’ finds authors similarities between ‘Automoderator’, ‘Autowikibot’, ‘totes_meta_bot’, and other it seems like non bot authors like ‘timewaitsforsome’, ect. It seems logical that those authors are connected through the same theme.</p>
<p>Now if we isolate theme 17 which is about ‘Politics, Science, and Star Wars’.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/images/clipboard-1197459568.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:80.0%"></p>
<p>We observe that still Automoderator and autowikibot are part of it as they have a relation in all theme which is logical. But we also observe now techrush andd beefat99 and tweetposter which might be humans for example.</p>
<p>We can continue to isolate other themes to understand the similarities between authors. But you get the idea, which is to understand the similarities between authors based on the themes they are connected to.</p>

<p>The data presented is a lighter subset (approximately 1/5 of the previous dataset) that includes only subreddits we successfully scraped, found descriptions for, and identified related subreddits. This smaller dataset was easier to compute and provides more interpretable results.</p>
<p>Not all subreddits list related subreddits on their pages. For example, two of the most commented subreddits (indicated by the black circles at the bottom right) are only related to each other.<br>
so the absence of a related subreddit for some subreddit does not diminish its importance in the graph.</p>
<p>To understand the graphs some nodes are colored to help understand the graph.</p>
<p>In the graph, the nodes are colored as follows: in blue are the subreddit with a score more than 4 (it allow us to see if some place in the graph have more high score subreddit than other) in red are the top 20 subreddit with the most comments (to see which subreddit are the most popular) in dark green are the top 20 subreddit who are the most related to other subreddit (subreddit who are the most connected to other subreddit)</p>
<p>Note that sometimes a subreddit can be in multiple categories.</p>

<p>The connections between subreddits generally align with expectations, validating the graph’s representation of thematic relationships.<br>
Some subreddit themes are not perfectly classified due to reliance on automated methods, which explains the presence of many subreddits on the periphery of the graph. A manual classification approach might improve accuracy.</p>

<p>The following Cypher query, implemented in Neo4j, calculates similarity scores between subreddits by analyzing shared connections:</p>
<div class="cell" data-layout-align="center">
<details class="code-fold">
<summary>Click to show code</summary>
<pre class="cypher cell-code"><code>MATCH (n:Subreddit)--(l)--(m:Subreddit)

MATCH (m:Subreddit)--(l)
WITH n,common, degree1, count(l) as degree2, m
WITH n,m, 100 * tofloat(common)/toFloat(degree1 + degree2 - common) as simi ORDER BY simi DESC
WITH n,collect(m)[..5] as similarnodes
UNWIND similarnodes as m
RETURN n,m</code></pre>
</details>

<p>This query identifies and ranks related subreddits, providing insights into their relationships. We endup with this graph below :</p>
<p><img src="index_files/images/graph_teacher.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<p>As we can see we have a new way to represent the graph with their similarities.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.8" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="observations-of-similarities"><span class="header-section-number">4.8</span> Observations of similarities</h2>
<p>The current dataset reveals clusters that are harder to interpret in the central region of the graph, but distinct thematic groups remain identifiable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sports Cluster</strong>: Located at the bottom, it showcases connections between athletic and sports-focused subreddits.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="index_files/images/sports_bottom_cluster.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cars/Racing Cluster</strong>: Found on the left, it groups subreddits centered on cars, motorsports, and racing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="index_files/images/cars_racing_cluster.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Gaming Cluster</strong>: Positioned at the top, this cluster aggregates gaming-related subreddits.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/images/gaming_cluster.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Science and Communities Cluster</strong>: Slightly above and to the right, this cluster includes discussions about science, life advice, and community engagement.</p>
<p><img src="index_files/images/science_community_cluster.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:50.0%"></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: In this graph, the top related subreddits are more dispersed and less connected to the clusters compared to the previous graph. We knew that the top related subreddits are not always the most popular or those with the highest scores. It is also notable that some subreddits have no connections to others within the graph.</p>

<h1 data-number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> LLM Integration</h1>
<p>Given the very dense nature of the graphs produced on Neo4J, we decided to integrate an LLM to help us analyze its output. Indeed, our Reddit comments dataset contains more than 30’000 observations, linked between each other through various metrics, such as sentiment, score, theme, etc.</p>
<p>For the LLM integration, we decided to use OpenAI’s API because of computational limitations on local LLMs. The model chosen is 4o-mini, to ensure a smooth, reliable, yet cheap process. The workflow for this API being standardized in Python, we use a virtual environment through the reticulate package to run Python code in RStudio. We then activate the script/virtual environment through the console.</p>
<p>This process being burdensome, we present on this page the outputs generated by OpenAI’s 4o-mini for 3 given queries made on Neo4J, to show its efficacy and flexibility.</p>

<p>Here below is ChatGPT’s breakdown of the contents and potential insights for the first example:</p>
<p>Key Nodes and Relationships:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Author Nodes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple authors are referenced, including <code>AutoModerator</code>, <code>autowikibot</code>, <code>smilesbot</code>, <code>TweetPoster</code>, <code>drocks27</code>, <code>expert02</code>, among others.</li>
<li>These authors demonstrate different behaviors or contributions associated with various themes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Theme Nodes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Themes are represented as nodes with varied IDs.</li>
<li>Each author is associated with multiple themes, indicating the likelihood of active participation across diverse topics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Relationships:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Each record represents a connection between an author (<code>a1</code>), a theme (<code>t</code>), and another author (<code>a2</code>), implying collaborative or contributive actions.</li>
<li>The repeated presence of certain authors like <code>TweetPoster</code> and <code>smilesbot</code> suggests they play a significant role across various themes.</li>
<li>The pairs of authors in <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code> show interactions that could convey collaboration, rivalry, or commentary on shared themes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Observed Patterns:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Active Collaboration:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors frequently appear multiple times with diverse themes, suggesting high collaboration or overlapping interest areas.</li>
<li>For instance, <code>smilesbot</code> appears in several records, partnered with various authors, pointing to a network of collaboration around similar themes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Presence of Bots:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Both <code>autowikibot</code> and <code>smilesbot</code> are bots, performing automated functions — possibly fact-checking or generating content.</li>
<li>Their participation in many interactions indicates their integration into the thematic discussions and content generation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Dynamic Interactions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>There are authors such as <code>drocks27</code> and <code>expert02</code> also appearing frequently, indicating they may be influential contributors or moderators who often engage in conversations across themes.</li>
<li>Fluctuations in author pairings (<code>a1</code> with <code>a2</code>) suggest differing degrees of engagement across themes, with potential shifts in themes provoking diverse author participation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Thematic Diversity:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Themes vary considerably (ID ranging from 1 to 20), indicating a rich multilingual landscape potentially encompassing numerous sub-genres or specializations.</li>
<li>The changing authors linked with specific themes may imply the themes evolve over time, attracting various contributors as community or topic interests shift.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Insights and Interpretation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engagement Strategy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Authors like <code>AutoModerator</code> may effectively moderate or incentivize interactions among contributors.</li>
<li>Understanding how themes guide author interactions can help in devising strategies for community engagement or content curation through bots.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Network Analysis:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Given the interlinked nature of authors and themes, carrying out network analysis could unveil pivotal authors or key topics driving community discussions.</li>
<li>Identifying central nodes (frequently engaged authors) may assist in targeting outreach or understanding influence dynamics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Behavioral Trends:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring the behavior of bot users versus human contributors can yield insights into content automation effects and potentially identify areas for enhancing user experience.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The data from the Neo4j query highlights a complex interplay of authors and themes, illustrating a vibrant community atmosphere marked by collaboration, thematic diversity, and automation. Further analysis could delve into temporal trends or sentiment analysis to refine understanding of community dynamics.</p>

<p>Here below is ChatGPT’s breakdown of the contents and potential insights for the second example:</p>
<p>The output you provided from the Neo4j database query represents records of relationships between various entities identified by their IDs. Each record consists of a pair of IDs (<code>a1.id</code> and <code>a2.id</code>), indicating a direct relationship between the two entities. Here are some insights and observations based on the data:</p>
<p>Key Observations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Main Entities</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Certain entities appear repeatedly in the dataset, indicating they’re likely central nodes in this network. For instance, <code>Explore_Uranus</code>, <code>Netprincess</code>, <code>knightstorm</code>, <code>catherder9000</code>, and <code>gangli0n</code> are active participants with multiple connections.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bimodal Relationships</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The dataset contains many mutual connections. For example, the relationships involving <code>catherder9000</code> and <code>knightstorm</code> suggest that these two entities share a close interaction, as they appear as both <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code> in various records.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Diversity and Clusters</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Entities like <code>Explore_Uranus</code>, <code>Netprincess</code>, and <code>Malos_Kain</code> connect to a diverse array of other entities, indicating they might be part of larger clusters or communities within the network. Conversely, entities like <code>adudeguyman</code> or <code>Buffalo__Buffalo</code> seem to have more confined networks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Directional Influence</strong>:
<ul>
<li>From names such as <code>AutoModerator</code>, <code>smilesbot</code>, <code>totes_meta_bot</code>, and others, it is evident that there are automated entities or bots interacting with users. These relationships might indicate a moderated environment that caters to user interactions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Patterns in Naming</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The IDs suggest a variety of user types and possible thematic areas of interest. Some names indicate a humorous or light-hearted approach, while others might imply more serious or specific themes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Connectedness</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Analysis reveals connections like <code>Dunkelz</code> to <code>Dorkamundo</code>, indicating the cross-linking between different user groups or communities. The presence of overlapping members in communities can be inferred from shared edges.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Patterns and Possible Insights:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Network Density</strong>:
<ul>
<li>When certain nodes (like <code>Explore_Uranus</code> or <code>catherder9000</code>) have many connections, they form hubs in the network. These hubs likely play crucial roles in facilitating interactions across the entire network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Community Detection</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Utilizing algorithms to assess community structure may reveal clusters of highly interconnected users. Communities can be visualized as subgraphs that are denser than connections outside them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Importance of Intermediary Nodes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Certain entities that act as bridges between groups can be identified. For example, if <code>Explore_Uranus</code> connects to both <code>Netprincess</code> and <code>k8reds</code>, it acts as a critical node linking different participants or clusters.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Centrality Measures</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Various centrality metrics (like degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality) can be computed to quantify the influence of particular nodes within the network. This will help in understanding the impact each user has on facilitating communication.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Temporal Dynamics</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If time data were integrated into the relationships, you could analyze how interaction patterns evolve over time, perhaps revealing trends or shifts in community interests.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Next Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>To derive further insights, visualizing the network using graph visualization tools could help identify clusters and pathways.</li>
<li>Additionally, examining the metadata associated with each user could provide context to interpret the relationships more meaningfully.</li>
<li>Analyzing the frequency and type of interactions may provide additional layers of insight into user engagement and community dynamics.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here below is ChatGPT’s breakdown of the contents and potential insights:</p>
<p>The query output provides a collection of nodes that represent authors, along with their relationships to other authors as determined by the collected <code>a2</code> values. Each record consists of an author identified by their <code>id</code> and a list of up to three related authors.</p>
<p>Let’s analyze the records to extract insights on the relationships and potential patterns:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Core Author Relationships</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Each author has connections to a few other authors, suggesting a collaborative or interconnected environment among the authors. This may imply shared topics, interests, or collaborative projects.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>High Connectivity</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The author <code>AutoModerator</code> appears in multiple relationships, suggesting that it may play a central role within this network. Multiple authors reference <code>AutoModerator</code>, including <code>totes_meta_bot</code>, <code>autowikibot</code>, and <code>TweetPoster</code>. This could indicate that <code>AutoModerator</code> is a significant contributor, possibly acting as a curator or mediator within the group.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Frequent Appearances</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Several other authors also appear more than once across different relationships, such as:
<ul>
<li><code>TweetPoster</code> (seen with <code>expert02</code>, <code>AutoModerator</code>, and <code>totes_meta_bot</code>)</li>
<li><code>totes_meta_bot</code> (connected to <code>AutoModerator</code>, <code>TweetPoster</code>, and <code>timewaitsforsome</code>)</li>
<li><code>smilesbot</code> (connected to <code>AutoModerator</code>, <code>autowikibot</code>, and <code>Voduar</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This recurring pattern suggests that there may be a smaller group of authors who are highly active and interlinked, indicating potential collaboration or influencer dynamics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Diverse Interconnections</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The records show a variety of authors with distinct IDs. Authors like <code>drocks27</code>, <code>knopper91</code>, and <code>son_bakazaru</code> are part of a cluster that does not significantly overlap with others. This can suggest specialization in different areas or topics, thus displaying a wider overall network.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Potential Clustering Effect</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The interconnectedness of authors can lead to the formation of clusters or communities within this dataset. For instance, authors like <code>expert02</code>, <code>TweetPoster</code>, and others form a small cluster. This potential clustering can be useful for identifying groups of authors who may share common interests or collaborate closely.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Disconnects and Unique Nodes</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Some authors appear only once in direct relationships, such as <code>itonlygetsworse</code> and <code>Voduar</code>. This could imply they either operate independently in certain contexts or have not yet formed relationships with the larger network, providing opportunities for networking.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, this dataset presents a snapshot of a potentially collaborative environment among authors, with some prominent figures standing out as pivotal points of connection. Understanding these relationships can help facilitate discussions or initiatives that enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing among authors. Further analysis could involve clustering techniques to visualize and explore these relationships in greater depth.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1" data-number="6">
<h1 data-number="6"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>In this project, we successfully explored the Reddit comments dataset through the integration of knowledge graphs and generative AI. This approach provided interesting insights into the dataset’s structure and content, demonstrating the effectiveness of knowledge graphs for modeling and visualizing complex relationships. By combining these graphs with generative AI, we highlighted their potential for knowledge synthesis and context-aware responses.</p>
<p>While our analysis showcased promising results, it also opened avenues for further exploration. Deeper investigations into deleted subreddits, subreddit themes, comment metadata, user activity, and temporal patterns could yield additional insights. For instance, applying more sophisticated models to classify subreddit themes or analyzing the interactions between users and comments could enhance our understanding of community dynamics.</p>
<p>Additionally, though we utilized a easy and straightforward method with an accessible API and Neo4j integration via Python, exploring the use of open-source models like Mistral trained on this dataset could refine results and provide a deeper understanding of the dataset’s nuances.</p>
<p>Moreover, the integration of generative AI with knowledge graphs could be further developed to create more interactive and context-aware systems. By leveraging advanced language models and graph-based reasoning, we could enhance the system’s ability to generate meaningful responses and insights.</p>
<section id="limitations" class="level2" data-number="6.1">
<h2 data-number="6.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Limitations</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Dataset Constraints: Size limitations of the dataset restricted the depth of our analysis, particularly in exploring temporal patterns, user behavior, and subreddit dynamics. A larger dataset would provide more comprehensive insights into Reddit’s ecosystem but we didn’t have the ressources to do so.</p></li>
<li><p>Lack of Data : The id and parent_id fields, while available, had limited utility due to the lack of a variable to identify the post. Uploading the full dataset would allow for a richer analysis, such as linking parent and child comments.</p></li>
<li><p>Theme Classification: Text mining of subreddit descriptions produced subpar results compared to manual classification. Implementing advanced models could improve accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>Deleted Subreddits: Analyzing deleted subreddits was challenging due to the absence of relevant data, limiting our ability to assess their impact or significance.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on Existing Subreddits: The analysis primarily centered on still-active subreddits, leaving potential insights from inactive or deleted subreddits unexplored.</p></li>
<li><p>Simplified Models: Time constraints led us to use simpler classification methods and models, leaving opportunities to enhance the analysis with more complex techniques.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these limitations, our project demonstrates a good introduction to knowledge graphs and the potential of combining KG and GenAI for analyzing and synthesizing insights from large-scale datasets. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies to build upon and deepen our understanding of complex digital ecosystems like Reddit.</p>

<p>For this, we will extensively use the quanteda package and the objects created above.</p>
<p>Then use the functions textstat_simil() and textstat_dist() to compute the Jaccard index matrix.</p>
<p>We choose the Jaccard index because it is a good measure of similarity between two documents.</p>

<p>We observe that similarity using Jaccard index on the top 1000 tf-idf words is inconclusive.</p>
<p>Indeed, we do not observe any clear pattern. This is due to the fact that we have a lot of words that are specific to each subreddit.</p>

<p>Hierarchical clustering and K-means. The first one is applied on the dissimilarities (Euclidean). The second one is applied on the features, here, TF-IDF. To illustrate the methods, we decide to create 3 clusters.</p>
<p>will try to cluster the subreddits to see if we can regroup them in a more meaningful way</p>

<p>Only 50 where selected to show, but same applies to all subreddits. Again, we observe that the clustering is not very clear, even worse. We have a lot of subreddits that are not well regrouped.</p>
<p>This is due to the fact that we have a lot of specific words in each subreddit.</p>
</section>
<section id="lsa" class="level3" data-number="7.2.3">
<h3 data-number="7.2.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lsa"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.3</span> LSA</h3>
<p>We restrict here the PCA for links between subreddits and topics to only dimension 2 and 3 to obverse its efficacy.</p>
<p>We only show the features (words) that are mostly related to dim2 and dim3 so that the chart is not overcrowded.</p>
<p>We observe for example that the word <code>fuck</code> is associated with dim 3 and is interestingly inversly correlated to the word <code>happy</code> which makes sense. This is more convincing than the similarity and clustering analysis we did before.</p>
<p>For readability, we apply it first on the top 10 subreddits to assess its application in our context.</p>
<ul>
<li>AskReddit is strongly associated with terms like “people” and “job,” indicating discussions about personal experiences and employment.</li>
<li>funny has a moderate association with “people” and “post,” suggesting content related to social interactions and posts.</li>
<li>CFB and league of legends are associated with terms like “team” and “game,” indicating discussions about sports and gaming.</li>
</ul>
<p>The terms are associated with different dimensions, indicating their importance in the context of the documents. Here are some key terms and their associations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dimension 1: “people” (0.1511), “question” (0.1346), “post” (0.1174)</li>
<li>Dimension 2: “team” (-0.2862), “play” (-0.2991), “game” (-0.5395)</li>
<li>Dimension 3: “fuck” (0.1837), “team” (0.1602), “call” (0.1255)</li>
<li>Dimension 4: “bowl” (0.1155), “boise” (0.0894), “steam” (-0.1784)</li>
<li>Dimension 5: “awesome” (-0.2124), “card” (-0.2553), “pc” (-0.2608)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we can see that it is not precise in our use-case, dim 4 and 2 and 3 seems quite similar..</p>
<p>We therefore inspect further with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The SVD coordinates help visualize the positioning of documents in the reduced-dimensional space, showing how closely related they are based on the terms they contain.</p>

<h3 data-number="7.2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lda"><span class="header-section-number">7.2.4</span> LDA</h3>
<p>LDA is a Bayesian version of the probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis. It answers the question “<em>Given this type of distribution, what are some actual probability distributions I am likely to see?</em>”</p>
<p>Topic 7 with subreddits such as AskReddit, funny, pics and news is the most popular topic with words like “people”, “time”, “im”, “youre” which may represent human experience and emotions. They touch on aspects of daily life, feelings, and the passage of time, with a bit of raw expression thrown in. It’s a mix of the mundane and the profound, capturing the essence of what it means to be human.</p>
<p>However, the distinction between topics is still not very clear. We observe a lot of overlapping terms within the different topics. (see Annex for more details on the diagnostic of the LDA)</p>

<p>The Topic-Term Analysis produces similar results as the LDA. This plot also provides the probabilities, therefore refining our understanding.</p>

<p>We observe that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Topic 1 may be related to ‘pc games’ (“game”, “pc”, “steam”, “play”, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Topic 2 seems to also be related to pc games, but more precisely to the game League of Legends, where terms such as “champions”, “ping”, “riot” and “team” are prevalent.</p></li>
<li><p>Topic 3 is also related to some sorts of games, we can maybe infer that it related to sports more specifically, with the presence of words such as “fan”.</p></li>
<li><p>Topic 4 is harder to distinguish with the presence of conflicting words such as “play”, “kill”, “run”, and “raid”.</p></li>
<li><p>Topic 5 seems to be related to feelings with words like “im”, time”, “day”, “feel”, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Topic 6 seems to be related to Crime and Justice with the presence of words such as “murder”, “evidence”, and “interview”.</p></li>
<li><p>Topic 7 seems to be related to news and world event with the presence of words such as “country”, “american”, “russia,” “war”.</p></li>

because a friend was suicidal and it was helpful At the very least it forces people to face the consequences of their words  and I strongly believe that suicide is not something to be used for manipulation It is way too serious an issue","You are SO not ready for a relationship of any kind right now The new girl was a rebound the novelty wore off and youre back to not really having much in common with her You miss your ex because you cant really get over someone you are still in contact with So its an ugly situation all around   You need to stay single for a while regardless of whether
