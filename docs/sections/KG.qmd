# Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide a robust framework for representing, managing, and analyzing complex relationships between entities. They serve as valuable tools for uncovering patterns and gaining insights from interconnected datasets, such as Reddit discussions.

## Neo4j

The initial construction of our Knowledge Graph was implemented in Neo4j. In this representation, we categorized the nodes as follows: authors in `blue`, comments in `pink`, themes in `green`, scores in `orange`, and sentiment in `red`.

![First Graph - Neo4J](index_files/images/graph.png){width="70%"}

As we increase the complexity of the graph by incorporating additional nodes and relationships, the relationships between different entities become more evident.

![Second Graph - Neo4J](index_files/images/clipboard-583397259.png){width="70%"}

Further complexity reveals richer insights but also introduces challenges in interpreting the data visually.

![Third Graph - Neo4J](index_files/images/clipboard-747420762.png){width="70%"}

## Gephi

As the complexity increase neo4j becomes really non efficient so we can use Gephi to visualize the graph.

### OpenOrd

Openord is a force-directed layout algorithm that is based on stress minimization. It is a good choice for large graphs.

![OpenOrd Layout with Theme Colored - Gephi](index_files/images/gephi1_openord.png){width="70%"}

We can ovserve here that the graph is really complex and hard to interpret. 

![OpenOrd Layout adding Scores in Blue - ](index_files/images/clipboard-2332198561.png){width="70%"}

Adding the scores nodes in blue did not help to understand the graph. So we'll try another layout.

### YifanHu - I

YifanHu is a force-directed layout algorithm that is based on the physical model of the system. It is a good choice for large graphs as well

#### Themes

Using YifanHu on gephi we can observe here an interesting representation of the prevalance of different theme in our dataset.

![YifanHu I - Color Labels](index_files/images/clipboard-927049404.png){width="70%"}

We observe here that theme 9 which is about 'Sports, Teams, and Player Discussions' is the most prevalent for example.

![YifanHu I - Theme Representation ](index_files/images/clipboard-2630725974.png){width="70%"}

#### Sentiment

adding sentiment in green (positive) and red (negative) complexifies the graph but can be useful to understand the sentiment of the different themes. We observe for example that theme 9 as a lot of 'red' which means that it is mostly negative compares to other themes.

![YifanHu I - Adding Sentiment Representation](index_files/images/clipboard-3037199124.png){width="70%"}

We can verify the amount of negative and positive sentiment for theme 9 and 2 to verify our assumptions : 

```{r sentiment, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
#check if theme 9 as indeed more negative sentiment
table_data <- df %>% filter(theme == 9) %>% group_by(sentiment_category) %>% summarise(n = n())

# Display the table using kable
kable(table_data, col.names = c("Sentiment Category", "Count"), caption = "Sentiment Category Counts for Theme 9")

#check if theme 9 as indeed more negative sentiment
table_data <- df %>% filter(theme == 2) %>% group_by(sentiment_category) %>% summarise(n = n())

# Display the table using kable
kable(table_data, col.names = c("Sentiment Category", "Count"), caption = "Sentiment Category Counts for Theme 2")
```

Which are indeed verified.

#### Scores

the same can be done with score in shades of blue but it becomes a bit more complex to interpret.

![YifanHu I - Adding Scores Representation](index_files/images/clipboard-688774298.png){width="50%"}

We will therefore try another layout with YifanHu

### YifanHu - II
#### Theme

We use the same color as previously to identify the different themes.

![YifanHu II - Themes Representation](index_files/images/yifanhu2themes.png){width="70%"}

#### Sentiment

We can therefore have another representation of the sentiment of the different themes. We still observe that theme 9 is mostly negative.

![YifanHu II - Sentiments Representation](index_files/images/yifanhu2sentiments.png){width="70%"}

#### Scores

We have here a better understanding of the score than in the previous graph.

We observe here the scores. `Green` for the higest scores and `red` for the lowest and `orange` for neutral.

![YifanHu II - Scores Representation](index_files/images/yifanhu2scores.png){width="70%"}

Theme 9 that we previously identified has interestingly a lot of high scores (lots of green) even if the overall sentiment is negative. This can be due to the fact that people are passionate about sports and can have strong opinions about it.

On the other hand theme 2 which is about 'Politics, Science, and Star Wars' has a lot of neutral scores.

## Similarities

### Author-Theme

They can also for example be used to understand similarities.

It was tried here to identifies connection through theme between authors with a similaritie score found through an THEME_AUTHORS relationship on NEO4J.

![Similarities Overview](index_files/images/clipboard-3780268986.png){width="80%"}

We observe that the small dots (authors) on the `left` side have a lots of connection through different theme nodes.

![](index_files/images/clipboard-2533163853.png){width="80%"}

For example here we observe the relationship of authors based on theme 1, which correspond to 'Rules, Information, and Wiki Communitie' finds authors similarities between 'Automoderator', 'Autowikibot', 'totes_meta_bot', and other it seems like non bot authors like 'timewaitsforsome', ect. It seems logical that those authors are connected through the same theme.

Now if we isolate theme 17 which is about 'Politics, Science, and Star Wars'.

![](index_files/images/clipboard-1197459568.png){width="80%"}

We observe that still Automoderator and autowikibot are part of it as they have a relation in all theme which is logical. But we also observe now techrush andd beefat99 and tweetposter which might be humans for example.

We can continue to isolate other themes to understand the similarities between authors. But you get the idea, which is to understand the similarities between authors based on the themes they are connected to.

## Subreddits

Subreddit Knowledge Graphs help visualize and analyze relationships between subreddits, uncovering meaningful connections and thematic clusters. In this section, we explore the relationships in a subset of our dataset, providing insights and observations.

## Disclaimer
The data presented is a lighter subset (approximately 1/5 of the previous dataset) that includes only subreddits we successfully scraped, found descriptions for, and identified related subreddits. This smaller dataset was easier to compute and provides more interpretable results.  

Not all subreddits list related subreddits on their pages. For example, two of the most commented subreddits (indicated by the black circles at the bottom right) are only related to each other.  
so the absence of a related subreddit for some subreddit does not diminish its importance in the graph.  

To understand the graphs some nodes are colored to help understand the graph.

In the graph, the nodes are colored as follows:
in blue are the subreddit with a score more than 4 (it allow us to see if some place in the graph have more high score subreddit than other)
in red are the top 20 subreddit with the most comments (to see which subreddit are the most popular)
in dark green are the top 20 subreddit who are the most related to other subreddit (subreddit who are the most connected to other subreddit)

Note that sometimes a subreddit can be in multiple categories.

## Clusters and Insights

### Sports Cluster  

A distinct **sports cluster** is visible, highlighting subreddits focused on athletic discussions and team-related themes.  

![](index_files/images/sport cluster.png){width="50%"}

### Connections Between Themes  

Some connections between seemingly unrelated topics are intriguing. For example, gardening and engineering are linked through **biology** and specifically **mycology**, with subreddits like "whatsthisplant" bridging these themes.  

![](index_files/images/gardening engineering.png){width="50%"}

### Nintendo Cluster 

The **Nintendo cluster** is another noteworthy group, bringing together subreddits focused on games like Zelda, Metroid, Pok√©mon, NES, and other Nintendo-related topics.

![](index_files/images/nintendo.png){width="50%"}

### Comics/Manga Cluster  

A clear **comics/manga cluster** is also observed, demonstrating the grouping of subreddits around shared cultural interests. 

![](index_files/images/comics manga.png){width="50%"}

### Observations 

The connections between subreddits generally align with expectations, validating the graph's representation of thematic relationships.  
Some subreddit themes are not perfectly classified due to reliance on automated methods, which explains the presence of many subreddits on the periphery of the graph. A manual classification approach might improve accuracy.  

## Subreddit Similarities

The following Cypher query, implemented in Neo4j, calculates similarity scores between subreddits by analyzing shared connections:

```{cypher, eval=FALSE,include=TRUE}
MATCH (n:Subreddit)--(l)--(m:Subreddit)
WITH n,count(l) as common, m
MATCH (n:Subreddit)--(l)
WITH n,common, count(l) as degree1, m
MATCH (m:Subreddit)--(l)
WITH n,common, degree1, count(l) as degree2, m
WITH n,m, 100 * tofloat(common)/toFloat(degree1 + degree2 - common) as simi ORDER BY simi DESC
WITH n,collect(m)[..5] as similarnodes
UNWIND similarnodes as m
RETURN n,m
```

This query identifies and ranks related subreddits, providing insights into their relationships. We endup with this graph below :

![](index_files/images/graph_teacher.png){width="50%"} 

As we can see we have a new way to represent the graph with their similarities.

## Observations of similarities

The current dataset reveals clusters that are harder to interpret in the central region of the graph, but distinct thematic groups remain identifiable:  

- **Sports Cluster**: Located at the bottom, it showcases connections between athletic and sports-focused subreddits.  

![](index_files/images/sports_bottom_cluster.png){width="50%"}

- **Cars/Racing Cluster**: Found on the left, it groups subreddits centered on cars, motorsports, and racing. 

![](index_files/images/cars_racing_cluster.png){width="50%"} 

- **Gaming Cluster**: Positioned at the top, this cluster aggregates gaming-related subreddits.  

  ![](index_files/images/gaming_cluster.png){width="50%"} 
  
- **Science and Communities Cluster**: Slightly above and to the right, this cluster includes discussions about science, life advice, and community engagement.  

  ![](index_files/images/science_community_cluster.png){width="50%"}
  
Conclusion: In this graph, the top related subreddits are more dispersed and less connected to the clusters compared to the previous graph. We knew that the top related subreddits are not always the most popular or those with the highest scores. It is also notable that some subreddits have no connections to others within the graph.
