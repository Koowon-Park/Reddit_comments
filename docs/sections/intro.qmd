## Overview and Motivation

### Context and Background

This project explores the intersection of knowledge graphs and generative AI using a Reddit comments dataset. Knowledge graphs, initially conceptualized by Rene Bakker in 1956 as a way to structure scientific knowledge, have evolved into versatile graph-based representations. Defined by McCusker et al. (2018) as sets of assertions (edges) between entities (vertices) that encode meaning, they incorporate provenance for justification and attribution. This project leverages knowledge graphs to model, visualize, and extract insights, demonstrating their potential when combined with generative AI for knowledge synthesis.

### Aim Of The Investigation

How can the combination of knowledge graphs and generative AI enhance our understanding and exploration of complex datasets like Reddit comments, and what unique insights can we uncover through this approach?

### Methodology

This project employed a variety of tools and technologies:

-   **R** and **Python** were used for data loading, cleaning, and processing.

-   **Neo4j** and **Gephi** were utilized to construct and visualize the knowledge graphs.

-   **Generative AI** (via API integration) was implemented to interact with the knowledge graph and generate context-aware responses.

The project workflow followed these key steps:

1.  **Data Preparation**: The Reddit dataset was loaded, processed, and enriched with additional variables after an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA).

2.  **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Knowledge graphs were created using Neo4j, and further visualized and analyzed using Gephi.

3.  **Integration with LLMs**: An API was used to enable seamless queries from Neo4j, demonstrating the ease and power of combining knowledge graphs with LLMs.

### Structure of the Report

This report is structured to provide a coherent narrative of our investigation:

1.  **Introduction**: Background, motivation, and objectives.

2.  **Data**: Overview of the dataset and preprocessing steps.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key findings from data exploration.

4.  **Knowledge Graphs and Generative AI**: Construction, insights, and integration of knowledge graphs with LLMs.

5.  **Conclusion**: Reflections on the investigation and potential future directions.

Through this structure, we aim to present a clear and compelling story of our exploration into knowledge graphs and generative AI using the Reddit dataset.
