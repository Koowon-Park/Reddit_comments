### Context and Background

A REFORMULER COPY PASTE DES SLIDES
History around the term knowledge graph
 1956, Rene Bakker (Utrecht) developed the notion of a Knowledge Graph in 
his Ph.D. Thesis as a way of structuring and representing scientific 
knowledge.
 1974, Marchi and Miguel defined a knowledge graph as a mathematical 
structure with vertices as knowledge units connected by edges that 
represent the prerequisite relation. Units of knowledge are only accessible if 
other units are previously known.
A (widely agreed) definition for the term 
knowledge graph is lacking.
 “...the use of the term has evolved and now may refer to a wide range of graphs, that 
may not include clear and unambiguous definitions or references.”
 McCusker et al. (2018), What is a Knowledge Graph?
 “We define a knowledge graph as: a graph, composed of a set of assertions (edges 
labeled with relations) that are expressed between entities (vertices), where the 
meaning of the graph is encoded in its structure, the relations and entities are 
unambiguously identified, a limited set of relations are used to label the edges, and 
the 
.” 
graph encodes the provenance, especially justification and attribution, of the 
assertions
