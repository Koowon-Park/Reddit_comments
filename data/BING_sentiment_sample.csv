cnasq6k,I understand your value of choice but what happens when the choice is so unassociated with ANY aspect of your life that having the option or not having it are identical to your utility function  For example I have a purple ball sent to Jupiter on a oneway spaceship And tell you that you cant have it This ball is an ordinary rubber ball It wont benefit you in ANY way You can choose to go through the effort of making the expedition necessary to retrieve that ball this includes advancing to the needed position in a countrys space program getting the technology to enter retrieve the ball and then exit the planets orbit etc all before you pass away of old age but you will not I hope Technically I suppose it is possible that you could But theres no benefit and a huge cost to you   Lets take a simpler example I tell you that you cant lift a jeep filled with cement unassisted This is fact You cant do this It is physically impossible As are 99999 of the things in the universe for you You cant be Superman You cant breathe in space You cant breathe fire Since you havent committed suicide I assume you know how to get over choices you are unable to take So why is taking away choices that wouldnt realistically assist you that big a deal I see your issue with specific situations where that MAY be the only way out But thats the case with many things in life You CANT do a lot of things including things that are actually possible for you But youre fine with that   In conclusion and I shall let this be my final comment as I know you are sick of this thread Your utility function doesnt seem very consistent,HPMOR,0.5,0.486111111,0.545454545

cnat1me,There are fears that Internet providers will be inundated with notices particularly since the government decided against establishing a fee for forwarding themThat could lead to increased costs for consumers  What some guy in the IT dept cant automate the system to handle the notices Shaw already have Is this an opening for the ISPs to charge more Im sure Google which handles 9 million take downs a week doesnt hire out to thousands of TFW to handle the work load ,canada,0.5,0.333333333,0.625
cnat56f,Although in those cases its really a regular CPU with an iGPU which has been fused out right  For example if the iGPU is faulty but the CPU core is perfectly fine theyd just disable the iGPU at the hardware level and ship it as a P model  They still make a fair amount of money and people who dont need an iGPU for anything get a slight discount  Either way its not like a different design where they take out the iGPU and replace it with more CPU maybe they could put more cache in there,hardware,0.714285714,0.458333333,0.78125
